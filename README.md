An Entropy Based Feature Selection- Application on Single cell RNA Sequence Data

# Summary


A novel and Robust Entropy based Feature (gene) Selection method for large Single-cell RNA-seq data, using  Renyi Â´and Tsallis entropy. The SC-REnF is also demonstrated for identifying marker genes from different cell types. Our results shed some light on the single-cell clustering problem with the application of entropy based feature selection, and therefore, it will be an important tool to complement existing methods in the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. Results are shown here in brief.

We will give the method demonstration with single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level.
